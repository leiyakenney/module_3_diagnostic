# README

Run through the standard Rails setup.

```
$ bundle install
$ figaro install
$ rake db:{create,migrate}
$ rails s
```

Navigate to http://localhost:3000

**Note** This works in dev, but my tests are still spotty. I also didn't manage to have enough time to refactor everything, but I figured that turning in something that works in dev is better than nothing. Overall, I'm not upset with this, though, as I did make it work in dev, and based on how this module started, that's a HUGE accomplishment. I still need some extra work and practice, but at least it worked.
